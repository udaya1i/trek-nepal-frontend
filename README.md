import { BrowserRouter, Routes as RouterRoutes, Route } from "react-router-dom";
import ScrollToTop from "components/ScrollToTop";
import ErrorBoundary from "components/ErrorBoundary";
// Add your page imports here
import HomePage from "pages/HomePage";
import AboutPage from "pages/AboutPage";

const Routes: React.FC = () => {
  return (
    <BrowserRouter>
      <ErrorBoundary>
        <ScrollToTop />
        <RouterRoutes>
          <Route path="/" element={<HomePage />} />
          <Route path="/about" element={<AboutPage />} />
          {/* Add more routes as needed */}
        </RouterRoutes>
